# Data_Science_Notebooks_and_Assignments
This repository contains notebooks that I have worked on as part of my learning assignments at GreyAtom

When learning Data Science, we need to be sleuths and should be able to answer the *What, Why and How* of Data.
I began my journey by going back in time and brushing up my Statistics, moving on to culling Insights and then finally learning to build Predictive models.
I call these three phases of my learning as *Hindsight*, *Insight* and *Foresight*.

``Hindsight`` | **Descriptive Statistics** : Answering "What has happened with the data? What is happening with the data?" through Descriptive Statistics

``Insight`` | **Inferential Statistics** : Answering "Why it has happened?" through Inferential Statistics

``Foresight`` | **Predictive Analytics** : Building Predictive Models to answer "What will happen in the future?"

Please Note: I have shared these workbooks to help the other learners in their Data Science journey and should not be reproduced or sold commercially
